# reactforce
A framework for building Salesforce applications with ReactJS

# Directory Structure
components : this is the directory that is posted to npm.  These are the officially supported reactforce components that are available for use.
components-import-demo : this is used to test the npm import process
components-prototypes : this is where you can build & test new components that could be contributed to the official components directory

# Roadmap
- Remove prop-types from the componenent dependencies - this is an implementation choice
